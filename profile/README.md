## 📌 About
DEVONthink for Mac is a robust document and knowledge management tool built for macOS. It allows you to capture, store, link, and search across all your files — PDFs, notes, web archives, images, and more.  
With smart classification, AI-based suggestions, and powerful search, DEVONthink helps you find the connections between your documents that you didn’t even know existed.  
It supports revision control and versioning, making it ideal for long-term research, archiving, or holding sensitive documents in a tamper-proof format. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
Because your data stays local by default (though sync is optional), you maintain full control and privacy over everything you store.  
Whether you're organizing research, managing large document libraries, or building a second brain, DEVONthink adapts to your workflow — and keeps evolving with regular updates.
